# Taskit
TaskIt is a personal productivity web app I built to help people stay on top of their daily lives, schoolwork, or personal projects in a simple and flexible way. It lets users create and manage to-do lists, organize tasks using flashcards, and build personalized planners or timetables to map out their schedules. Each task can be prioritized, tagged with a due date, and marked as complete when finished. You can also filter and sort your tasks by completion status, importance, or deadlinesâ€”making it easier to focus on what matters most at any given time.

TaskIt includes an interactive Gantt chart view to visualize task timelines and progress across projects. It also features a built-in diary for keeping daily notes or reflections, and a note-taking area for jotting down quick ideas or reminders. Whether you're managing assignments, planning events, or tracking personal goals, TaskIt brings everything together in one place without overwhelming you.
